\section{Deep Learning HTM Encoder}
A potential solution to most of the aforementioned issues could be to combine the deep learning approaches with an HTM network. This way it could be possible to leverage the self-supervision and noise resilience property of HTM, together with the powerful feature extraction and representation of deep learning approaches. Effectively combining the best of both approaches while eliminating the disadvantages that have been previously mentioned.
